### Steps I followed for the Tuning of the Phi3 Model for the desired learning and output from the customer - product relational queries
1. **Understanding the Model**: First, I learned about the Phi3 model, which is a type of artificial intelligence that can understand and generate text based on examples it's given. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/phi-3-tutorial)

2. **Getting the Tools Ready**: I made sure I had all the necessary tools to work with the Phi3 model. This included setting up my environment and making sure I had access to the OpenAI API.

3. **Preparing Training Data**: Next, I collected examples of questions and their corresponding answers. These examples would be used to teach the Phi3 model how to answer similar questions in the future.

4. **Fine-Tuning the Model**: Using the training data, I fine-tuned the Phi3 model. This involved sending the examples to the model and adjusting its parameters so that it learns from them.

5. **Testing the Model**: Once the model was trained, I tested it by asking it questions similar to the ones in the training data. This helped me see how well the model had learned and whether it could provide accurate answers.

6. **Generating Outputs**: Finally, I used the trained Phi3 model to generate outputs for new questions. This involved feeding the model a question and letting it generate an answer based on what it had learned during training.
